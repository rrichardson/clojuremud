verb flow

string is submitted, handler dispatches off of first word, the verb
verb is executed in context of items in room, room and global
conflicts at each scope level result in a list started with the narrowest
scope and ending with the largest scope

verbs are functions which
take a subject (the caller)
the collective output
the command line

they generate a map of :
objects that they would mutate
their output in a list

they pass this map to their next object in a chain and 'usually' return the result.
